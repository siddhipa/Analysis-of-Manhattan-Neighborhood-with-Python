# Analysis-of-Manhattan-Neighborhood-with-Python
Analysing data related to neighborhoods of Manhattan in order to find an optimal location for opening a new fitness center(Gym/Yoga Studio)


This is my very first Data Science Project and it is done as a part of IBM data science certification course on Coursera. As a novice in Data Science field, I have tried to analyse the neighborhoods present in Manhattan, New York using Python. I have used JSON file and Foursquare API to get the dataset of Manhattan neighborhoods and their located venue places. I have cleaned and processed this dataset in order to obtain valid and promising neighborhoods. K-means clustering is used to find optimal locations among these neighborhood to open a Gym/Yoga Studio.

Please refer to comments written in python notebook to understand the purpose of each step. Also, report and presentation have uploaded for more clarity of this project.
